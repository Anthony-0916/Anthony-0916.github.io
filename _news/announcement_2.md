Learning to ride a bicycle has been a very difficult task for me since I was young. I have tried many times, but I have not been able to achieve it. Due to the large area of Nanjing University, in order to make it more convenient for me to go to and from school, I have worked hard to learn how to ride a bicycle.

This is the progress of my bicycle learning and cycling：

The benefits of cycling are to exercise the respiratory system. Riding a bicycle can increase lung capacity, promote blood circulation, and accelerate material metabolism. The function of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems can be continuously strengthened.

Riding is a simple task for many people, but for me, it was a change that took many attempts to succeed. I hope to improve my cycling skills, exercise my body, entertain my body and mind, and become a more powerful rider in the future.
