The concept of communication ceremony is a supplement and update to the concept of communication, using ceremony as a metaphor to point out that communication is a consciousness that gathers people together as a group or a common identity. It has created a research paradigm in cultural communication studies, but at the same time, it also has limitations, such as excessive criticism of utilitarianism and purposefulness, falling into the circle of functionalism, and ignoring the critical elements of Marxism. The subjective awareness of research results is too strong, relying on the researcher's ability to observe and perceive.
