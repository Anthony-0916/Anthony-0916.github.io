Jiao Qiancheng was born in Huaibei, Anhui in 2000. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Radio and Television from Communication University of China and a master's degree in Journalism and Communication from Nanjing University.

During my undergraduate studies, I took many courses related to television, news, and communication, and conducted many practical exercises. I have interned at units such as People's Daily and Phoenix Weekly, participated in writing, planning, and operation work, and accumulated some experience. I once tried to publish my edited works on the internet, with a maximum playback volume exceeding 300000; Attempting to operate my own Little Red Book, with around 2300 fans currently; I have participated in Weibo topic planning, with multiple topics appearing on hot searches and a single Weibo with a maximum reading volume exceeding 100 million.

I enjoy watching movies, cycling, and traveling. While I love work, I also enjoy life and hope to achieve a balance between work and life.
